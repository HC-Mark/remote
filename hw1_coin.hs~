-- Problem 1 (counting coins)

{- Your job in this problem is to calculate the smallest number of
   pennies, nickels, and dimes that can be used to add up to the given
   amount. For example, to make 7 cents, a total of 3 coins are
   needed (two pennies and a nickel); to make 99 cents, 14 coins are
   needed (9 dimes, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies). Fill in the body of the
   function 'coins' below so that it returns the right answer. Prefer
   guards over `if`/`then`/`else`. -}

coins = error "coins: unimplemented"

      sum [d | if total >=10 then d <- 1, coins (total- 10)
               else if total == 0,then d <-0
               else if total == 1,then d <-1
               else if total == 2,then d <-2
               else if total == 3,then d <-3
